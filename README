1) make sure that on the same dir level as "src" under "Edges",
   you have these directories:

		include
		lib  
		bin
		data

2) make sure you have a env variable called "EDGES" pointing
   to the base directory were "src" sits.  mine at home is

		/home/vma/Edges

3) The executable you get after you compiled everything will
   sit in $EDGES/src/silhouette (called silhouette for historical
   reason.. will probably change soon)  if you run it, you will see an
   interface like you will see in the screen shot section. by default
   it will show nothing until you load in a model.  If you do, and it
   loaded successfully, the default is for the program to display the
   stripified version of the model.

4) you can use the mouse to rotate the model around

		left button = rotate
		mid button = pan
		right button = zoom

5) if you unpress hidden line you will see the original mesh outlines
   in blue.

6) don't worry about the other UI widgets.. they may or may not work
   for you.  If they do, you will the the silhouette edges of the
   model.
