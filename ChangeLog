    Added "Op", a class that implements the "visitor" design pattern.
    What it does is that it allows subclasses to provide a particular
    functionality to the core classes of Edges without having to
    change the code of latter.  An example is "IVOutputOp", originally
    was code in each of the core Edges classes that outputs data
    compatable to the Inventor format.  These methods are now taken
    out of the core classes and put into IVOutputOp.

    The rest of the classes are changed to make use of Op.
